## Here's how we use it

Other things here. Lorem ipsum, and so on.

Hi, I’m Linus.
I’m a writer and software engineer working on and thinking about opportunities in education, technology, and community.

I’ve written over 400k words about creative work, community, startups, and life on this blog, and about software and computing on my technical blog dotink.co. I’ve made 120+ side projects ranging from programming languages and compilers to 3D renderers, original studio albums, interactive learning environments, UI libraries, art projects, and a suite of personal productivity tools that power my life.

I believe that good taste, exercised judiciously, with good people, make the difference. I’ve been a part of Dorm Room Fund, Cal Hacks, and the Anvil building student founder communities, and early-stage teams at Repl.it and Hack Club rethinking how young people are building our future. I’m currently at Ideaflow to build tools that amplify our collective creativity.

I’m on my second leave from UC Berkeley, where I studied rhetoric and computer science. I play piano and guitar, draw sometimes, and like to travel. Each year, I set ten goals for myself. You can read my goals for 2021 here.

If you want to hear about what I'm building, writing, and thinking about each week, sign up for my weekly newsletter. My last issue is here.
